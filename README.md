<p>
	Hello! I’m Ali.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I am a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aligundogdu/" target="_blank">Chief Technology Officer</a> at <a
                href="https://gensuretech.com" target="_blank">GensureTech</a>
            and a dedicated <strong>Indie
            Maker</strong>.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Currently, I lead the technology strategy at GensureTech, where we build scalable CRM and product solutions
            for the insurance industry. My focus isn't just on writing code, but on designing systems that solve real
            business problems and leading teams that enjoy the process.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>From Web 1.0 to the Future</strong><br/>
            With over 20 years of experience, I’ve witnessed technology evolve from static HTML pages to the AI-driven
            future we are building today. My journey hasn't been a straight line; from founding my own software agency
            to developing FinTech products, it took me through the rigorous demands of the Energy sector in Europe and
            the high-stakes Private Security industry in Turkey. These experiences taught me that the best technology is
            the one that serves humans, not the other way around.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>The Maker Mindset</strong><br/>
            I believe a CTO should never lose touch with the "kitchen." That’s why I continue to build personal projects
            like <a href="https://seodisias.com" target="_blank">Seodisias</a> (a desktop SEO tool) and <a
                href="https://spylooks.com/" target="_blank">SpyLooks</a> (a server management tool). This hands-on
            approach keeps my
            engineering skills sharp and allows me to explore modern stacks directly.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>The Analog Life</strong><br/>
            When I step away from the keyboard, I call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denizli" target="_blank">Denizli</a>
            home. I live here with my lovely wife and our two "little
            adventurers" who remind me daily that life is the most complex project to manage. You can often find me
            exploring <a href="https://github.com/aligundogdu/GeoMagnet-Project" target="_blank">ancient cities</a>,
            capturing moments <a href="https://unsplash.com/@gundogduali" target="_blank">through photography</a>, or <a
                href="https://github.com/aligundogdu/TerraStl" target="_blank">3D printing</a> toys
            for the kids.
